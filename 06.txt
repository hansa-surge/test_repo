Task 6: Containers are items too (1 mark)
"What do you mean the program won't let me pick up a container? Containers are items too! Always have been!" fulminates Fibonacci. "Anyway, if the program doesn't allow it yet, it's only a small matter of programming."
"And we should be able to make pyramids of them and create an infinite capacity loophole. Handy Haversacks go brrrrrr," deadpans Robbie.
"Ooh, recursion, that's brilliant! Let's get the student to do that! Add to cart!", exults Fibo.ü§úü§ñü§õ
A few moments later üï∞Ô∏è
"I'm sorry, mate", apologises Robbie. "This one is kind of on me. I understand if you've had enough. You probably have better things to do. Anyway, you know the green tick is a lie, right?" ‚úÖüç∞
Robbie makes a valid point. This is going to take hours. What about your other assignments?

Task Description
Expand your program so that:
	‚Ä¢	Containers can be looted and stored just like other items.
	‚Ä¢	When looting and storing an item (including containers), it is placed in the first possible container:
	‚Ä¢	if it can be stored in the current container, it is,
	‚Ä¢	otherwise, containers (and other containers within) placed in the current container are tested in the order in which they were stored to determine if the item can be stored there, and
	‚Ä¢	any container inside the current container is tested before any container at the same level as the current container.
	‚Ä¢	Items more than one level inside a container affect the weight of all containers containing this item (but a magic container will also affect this). This means that if item X is put in non-magic container B, itself inside non-magic container A, then the weight of X both applies to A and B, and they both must have enough capacity. However, if B is magic, then the weight of X only applies to B. See Examples 1 and 2.
This type of recursive search is called a preorder depth-first search.

Task 4: Magic containers (1.5 marks)
"It's not a proper adventure game without magic items," asserts Fibo. Robbie concedes, reluctantly. You know what must be done ðŸ¤· 
Task Description
An additional file, magic_containers.csv, now provides the description of containers that behave like containers with a single compartment, but that do no increase in weight if items are stored in them. They still have a maximum capacity, though.
Magic containers
Displaying a magic container looks like:
==================================
Enter your choice:
1. Loot item.
2. List looted items.
0. Quit.
==================================
2
Bag of Holding (total weight: 40, empty weight: 40, capacity: 4910/5000)
   A normal cheese platter (weight: 1000)
   Elena's fishing count (weight: 3500)
   Tan's Tamagotchi Support Group (weight: 410)
   Pierre's funny meme collection (weight: 0)
The total weight remains equal to the empty way. The capacity is computed as for a non-magical container. See Example 1 for a complete example.
Your program must retain the same functionality as in Task 3, which is to say that it should be possible to select at the beginning any of the containers covered so far. See Example 2.

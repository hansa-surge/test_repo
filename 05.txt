Task 5: Magic multiple compartments (1.5 mark)
"But what about these containers with multiple compartments? Can't they be magic? That's discriminatory!" explodes Fibonacci ü§Øüê∞üåã
"Beep", sighs Robbie ü§ñ
Task Description
An additional file, magic_multi_containers.csv, now provides the description of containers that behave like containers with multiple compartments, and, like the other magic containers, do no increase in weight if items are stored in them. Each compartment still has a maximum capacity.

Professor Farnsworth's Lab Coat (total weight: 0, empty weight: 0, capacity: 0/0)
   A small pocket (total weight: 100, empty weight: 0, capacity: 100/100)
      Pierre's daily cheese wheel (weight: 100)
      Gabe's Steam game library (weight: 0)
      Robbie's final drop of sanity (weight: 0)
   A medium pocket (total weight: 186, empty weight: 0, capacity: 186/200)
      Paul's only frontal lobe (weight: 9)
      Robbie's shower thoughts (weight: 150)
      Crimpy's destroyed cat toys (weight: 27)
   A small pocket (total weight: 27, empty weight: 0, capacity: 27/100)
      Crimpy's destroyed cat toys (weight: 27)
==================================
The total weight remains equal to the empty way. The capacity is computed as for a non-magical container with multiple compartments, which is that it is computed and displayed at the compartment level. See Example 1 for a complete example.
Your program must retain the same functionality as in Task 4, which is to say that it should be possible to select at the beginning any of the containers covered so far. See Example 2.
